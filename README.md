# Gaussian Process Regression Emulator Developmental Workspace

This repository contains a large majority of our team's draft work and early approaches to developing a Gaussian Process Regression Emulator. 

You'll notice there is a collection of folders found under the Scripts folder, these detail early iterations of our workflow, as well as ideas for future scaffolding. To see the final version of the dashboard contents workflow, please visit our official repository: https://github.com/GaiaFuture/CLM5_PPE_Emulator.
